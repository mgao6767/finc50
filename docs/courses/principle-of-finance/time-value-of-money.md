# Time Value of Money

The time value of money is the concept that money today is worth more than the same amount of money in the future. This is because ==money has the potential to earn interest or grow over time==. In other words,

> a dollar received today is more valuable than a dollar received in the future.

There are two main reasons why money today is worth more:

**Opportunity Cost**: When you have money now, you have the opportunity to invest or save it, and it can grow over time. By investing or saving, you can earn interest or returns on your money. If you delay receiving the money, you miss out on these potential earnings or returns.

??? example
    You have $1,000 today, and you have two options to use the money:

    1. Deposit it in a bank account, which pays 5% interest (i.e., \($1,000\times5\%=$50\)) in a year.
    2. Use it to buy a smart phone now.

    If you choose to buy a smart phone, you forego the ^^opportunity^^ to earn the $50 interest if you deposit it in a bank account for a year. That is, the ==_opportunity cost_== of buying smart phone is $50.

**Inflation**: Inflation refers to the general increase in prices over time, which means that the same amount of money will buy you less in the future.(1) So, having money today allows you to buy more goods and services compared to the same amount of money in the future.

1.  In other words, the _purchasing power_ of money decreases over time.

??? example
    The Australian housing price, like many other countries, increases a lot over the past decades.

    ```vegalite
    {%
      include "../../vega/australia_housing_price_index.json"
    %}
    ```

    For example, a certain house may cost $250,000 in 1994 but $1,340,000 in 2021. Although only part of this difference is due to inflation, we can still notice that "_houses are more expensive now than decades ago_".

*[purchasing power]: The amount of goods and services that can be acquired with a given amount of money.

Understanding the time value of money is important because it affects various financial decisions, such as saving, investing, and borrowing. For example, it helps you understand the impact of interest rates, the growth potential of investments, and the cost of borrowing money.
